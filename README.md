<h3 align="center">🔐 Breaking things to build better defenses</h3>

<p align="center">
Started with a simple question: <em>"How do attackers think?"</em> Now I'm a cybersecurity graduate student obsessed with answering that question — and building systems that stop them.
</p>

<p align="center">
Every repo here is where theory meets practice — hands-on labs in exploit development, enterprise firewall design, network security, and identity & access management. If it can be attacked, I want to understand how. If it can be defended, I want to build it.

## 🎯 What Drives Me
> Offensive skills. Defensive mindset. Real-world impact.

- 🔍 **What I love:** Pulling apart how attacks work at a technical level
- 🛠️ **What I build:** Security automation, access control systems, and lab environments
- 🏥 **Where I want to go:** Healthcare cybersecurity — protecting systems that matter most
